# Get_GOES

A learning notebook that guides the user on how to generate a deep learning ready dataset from GOES imagery.

The learning objectives include:

1. Given a date and time, download the corresponding GOES satellite imagery from AWS
2. From the raw GOES imagery, use SatPy to apply a projection then correct and proccess a True Color composite for the Continental US (CONUS)
3. Visualize CONUS True Color composite imagery
4. Given a location of interest, create a geographically localized image that is appropiately sized for input to a machine learning application
5. Visualize machine learning reaedy raw and composite imagery
